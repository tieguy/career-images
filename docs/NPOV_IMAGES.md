# NPOV and Image Diversity in Wikipedia

This document provides context and policy framework for the Wikipedia Career Images project.

## Existing Wikipedia Resources

### Wikipedia Essay: Visual Representation of Women
**URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Visual_representation_of_women

This essay directly addresses the lack of diverse images in Wikipedia articles, noting:
- Gender bias in visual content is a persistent issue
- Less than 13% of Wikipedia contributors are female (2011 survey)
- Only 19.65% of biographical articles are about women (September 2023)
- Efforts like WikiProject Women in Red aim to address content gaps

### Core Policy: Neutral Point of View (NPOV)
**URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view

NPOV is one of Wikipedia's three core content policies. Key points:
- All content must be written without editorial bias
- Represent fairly and proportionately all significant viewpoints
- This policy is non-negotiable

While NPOV traditionally focuses on text, the principles apply to images:
- Images should be representative, not cherry-picked to push a viewpoint
- Using only images of one gender for a career article may introduce bias
- Diverse representation helps ensure neutrality

### Related Article: Gender Bias on Wikipedia
**URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_on_Wikipedia

Documents the systemic gender gap in Wikipedia content and editorship.

## Academic Research

### Visual Gender Biases in Wikipedia (2022)
- Study examined biographies across 300 occupations in 10 languages
- Found male bias often arises during editor selection of which subjects get Wikipedia pages
- Men's biographies tend to have more images across all languages
- Female biographies average better visual quality when present

### Online Images Amplify Gender Bias (Nature, 2024)
- Gender bias is more prevalent in images than text
- Underrepresentation of women is substantially worse in images
- Image search amplifies gender bias in people's beliefs

## How This Project Supports NPOV

This career images project supports NPOV by:

1. **Identifying gaps**: Finding career articles that lack diverse imagery
2. **Providing alternatives**: Connecting editors with CC-licensed diverse images via Openverse
3. **Enabling informed review**: Showing current images alongside replacement options
4. **Tracking progress**: Monitoring which articles have been improved

## Recommended Approach

When reviewing career articles for image diversity:

1. **Consider the current images**: Do they represent only one demographic?
2. **Assess the career**: Is it genuinely gender-specific, or could it use diverse representation?
3. **Use quality images**: Diversity shouldn't mean lower quality - find good images
4. **Respect licensing**: Only use images with Wikipedia-compatible licenses
5. **Add, don't replace**: Consider adding diverse images rather than removing existing ones

## Case Study: LuisVilla's Image Diversity Edits (2017-2018)

Analysis of [LuisVilla's Wikipedia contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/LuisVilla) shows a sustained effort to improve image diversity in career articles starting in late 2017. Here's what we found about persistence:

### Edits That Persisted (Still Present as of January 2026)

| Article | Edit Date | What Was Added | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Prime Minister** | 2017-11-19 | "More modern, representative picture" - First diversity edit! | ✅ Still present (Sirimavo Bandaranaike, first female PM) |
| **Head of Government** | 2017-11-19 | "Gender-balanced and geography-balanced the page" | ✅ Still present |
| **Programmer** | 2018-04-28 | "More representative and historically significant lead photo" | ✅ Still present (Ada Lovelace, ENIAC women) |
| **System Administrator** | 2018-05-11 | High-quality photo of sysadmin | ✅ Still present |
| **Actuary** | 2018-05-14 | Modern photo in modern profession paragraph | ✅ Still present |
| **Film Director** | 2018-05-14 | Gallery "more representative of recent award-winners" | ✅ Still present (Cannes jury photo) |
| **Chef** | 2018-05-23 | Tandoori chef photo, Nancy Silverton photo | ✅ Still present |
| **Sommelier** | 2018-05-23 | Image in Education section | ✅ Still present |
| **Head of Government** | 2018-05-25 | G7 photo replacing less diverse Nordic Council photo | ✅ Still present |
| **Judge** | 2018-10-27 | Group photos of judges (ICJ hearing, US Supreme Court 2010, Native Judges) | ✅ Still present |
| **Farmer** | 2018-10-27 | FFA greenhouse training photo showing diverse farmers | ✅ Still present |
| **Chief Executive Officer** | 2018-10-28 | Group photo of Fortune 500 CEOs in 2015 | ✅ Still present |

### Timeline

The effort began on **November 19, 2017** with edits to Prime Minister and Head of Government, then expanded over the following year to cover 12+ career articles. The campaign showed a consistent methodology:
1. Start with high-visibility political roles
2. Expand to professional/technical roles (Programmer, System Administrator, Actuary)
3. Move to service professions (Chef, Sommelier)
4. Finally tackle judicial and executive roles (Judge, CEO)

### Key Observations

1. **Group photos work well**: Adding group photos (Supreme Court, Fortune 500 CEOs, judge panels) is an effective strategy because:
   - Groups naturally show diversity
   - Less likely to be reverted (not about a specific person)
   - Illustrates the profession broadly rather than spotlighting individuals

2. **Historical pioneers work well**: Using images of historical "firsts" (Ada Lovelace, ENIAC women programmers, Sirimavo Bandaranaike as first female PM) provides both diversity AND historical significance.

3. **Quality matters**: Edit summaries emphasized "higher-quality", "more colorful", "better lit" - suggesting diversity improvements paired with quality improvements are more durable.

4. **Talk page engagement helps**: For contentious articles like Chef, LuisVilla engaged on the Talk page first (Talk:Chef "Photo request" discussions) before making changes.

5. **Persistence over time**: Edits from 2017-2018 are still present in 2026 (7-8 years later), suggesting these improvements are valued by the editing community.

### Notable Edit Summaries

From LuisVilla's contribution history:

> "Use a somewhat more modern, representative picture." (Prime Minister, 2017-11-19) - **The first edit**

> "Gender-balanced and geography-balanced the page a bit" (Head of Government, 2017-11-19)

> "More representative and historically significant lead photo." (Programmer, 2018-04-28)

> "Use more group pictures of judges to improve representation. Hopefully more later." (Judge, 2018-10-27)

> "Add an image of a group of Fortune 500 CEOs." (CEO, 2018-10-28)

> "Newer, better tandoori photo. But not helping the gender balance on this page at all :(" (Chef, 2018-05-26)

> "Not ideal (would like to find a good image with gender balance) but better than it was." (Lawyer, 2017-12-01)

### Lawyer Article - Ongoing Challenge

The Lawyer article edits show the ongoing challenge:
- Multiple attempts to improve diversity (2017-11-30, 2017-12-01, 2018-05-08)
- Edit summaries express frustration: "Would love to have found a picture of a group of lawyers together, but no luck so far?"
- Current article does include female lawyers (Clara Shortridge Foltz, Helena Normanton) but finding group photos of diverse lawyers remains difficult

This case study demonstrates that individual editor efforts CAN make lasting improvements to Wikipedia's visual representation, particularly when using group photos and engaging with the community.
