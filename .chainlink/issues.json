Alphabetical within buckets feels more neutral and makes browsing easier.\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Define ~10-15 buckets (e.g., 10k+, 5k-10k, 2k-5k, 1k-2k, 500-1k, 200-500, 100-200, 50-100, <50)\n- Sort by bucket descending, then alphabetically within bucket\n- Show bucket range in UI instead of exact count\n- Consider making buckets configurable or using log scale\n\n[Migrated from beads: career-images-boh]",

      "description": "From brainstorm: Currently the tool stores workflow state (review status, notes, replacement decisions) in its own database. This could be seen as 'off-wiki coordination.'\n\nConsider moving this to Wikipedia-native infrastructure:\n- WikiProject task lists\n- Talk page banners (e.g., |image-diversity=needs-review parameter)\n- User subpages for personal todo lists\n\nBenefits:\n- Transparency (decisions visible to community)\n- Avoids 'coordination database' optics\n- Integrates with existing Wikipedia workflows\n\nTradeoffs:\n- More friction when reviewing articles\n- Requires community buy-in for new banner parameters\n\nWait for WIR feedback before deciding - they may have opinions on best practices.\n\n[Migrated from beads: career-images-17k]",
