For this project (improving diversity in career article images), we need to understand or articulate how NPOV applies to visual representation.\n\nResearch:\n- Search for existing Wikipedia essays/discussions on image neutrality\n- Look for discussions about representation, diversity, and NPOV in images\n- Check Wikipedia:Neutral point of view and related policy pages\n- Review Wikipedia talk pages for discussions on this topic\n\nGoal:\n- Either find an existing essay that addresses this\n- Or write/draft one that explains the problem space\n- Document the policy/philosophical framework for why diverse representation in career images matters within Wikipedia's guidelines\n\nThis will provide important context and justification for the work being done by this tool.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-13T11:39:12.192346669-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-13T11:39:12.192346669-08:00"}

{"id":"career-images-k0c","title":"Build test infrastructure for career-images scripts","description":"Currently the scripts have no automated tests. Need to add test infrastructure to ensure reliability.\n\nRecommended approach:\n- Use pytest as testing framework\n- Add pytest to pyproject.toml dependencies\n- Create tests/ directory structure\n- Test categories needed:\n  1. Unit tests for individual functions (parsing, calculations, data transformations)\n  2. Integration tests with mocked API responses (Wikidata, Wikipedia pageviews)\n  3. End-to-end tests with small datasets\n\nKey areas to test:\n- list-fetcher.py:\n  - SPARQL query generation\n  - Wikipedia title extraction and encoding/decoding\n  - Pageview data parsing and calculation\n  - JSON output format validation\n- list-enrich.py:\n  - JSON data loading\n  - Sorting/filtering logic\n  - CSV export format\n  - Search functionality\n  - Statistics calculations\n\nMock strategy:\n- Mock requests.get() for API calls\n- Use fixture data for Wikidata/Wikipedia responses\n- Create small test datasets (5-10 articles)\n\nThis will enable confident refactoring and prevent regressions as features are added.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-13T13:01:19.554386644-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-13T13:01:19.554386644-08:00"}
